			Caesar Salad
		</div>
		<p>
			The Caesar salad is a beloved, quintessential side option. This is probably one of the only salads that could be considered comfort food.Writing the origin story of any dish can be a controversial affair. For example, don't even get Tampanians and Miamians started about who invented the Cuban sandwich. Food is deeply personal because it's a cultural affair. The Caesar salad is no different.In fact, the Caesar salad has a surprising history that may shock most foodies. Where did the Caesar salad originate? Keep reading to find out.Many people think the Caesar salad was named after Julius Caesar -- it's not. The Caesar salad was invented by an Italian man named Caesar Cardini. Italians can rest assured that there was Italian influence behind its creation.Cardini was a restauranteur who was born in northern Italy. As a chef, he settled in North America and worked in many restaurants before stumbling upon his seminal creation. He opened a least two restaurants in California before inventing the Caesar salad elsewhere.Caesar Cardini was born in 1896. As expected, it's a little difficult tracing someone's life so long ago. However, an advertisement from Cardini's restaurant in 1919 suggests he moved to California in the 1910s. Early records document his first joint venture in Sacramento. There is also evidence that he worked at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Later, he opened another restaurant in San Diego.However, in 1920, Prohibition threw a wrench in his restauranteur dreams. It was shortly after this that he invented his famous salad.

			Beef Wellington
		</div>
		<p>
			Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin, made out of fillet steak coated with pâté (often pâté de foie gras) and duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or parma ham to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.A whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving, or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions prior to wrapping and baking.Known across the world as Gordon Ramsay’s signature dish, the Beef Wellington is something we’re immensely proud of.Served at our restaurants across the globe, from Bread Street Kitchen in St Paul's to Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen in Dubai and Las Vegas, this classic dish is a recognised show-stopper at any dining experience. Don’t miss your chance to try it for yourself. Seeking the epitome of British food experience whilst visiting London? Or simply looking to learn the tricks of the Wellington trade? From a Beef Wellington Chef’s Masterclass at Savoy Grill to a Beef Wellington Experience at Heddon Street Kitchen, there’s never been a better excuse to master this memorable Gordon Ramsay dish.

			Rainbow roll
		</div>
		<p>
			Rainbow roll is a type of uramaki sushi roll filled with cucumber, avocado and crab stick. It is prepared with multiple types of fish, most commonly tuna, salmon, white fish, yellowtail, snapper, and eel. Rainbow roll is quite similar to California roll, with the addition of tuna, salmon and avocado.Other variants include slices of mango next to avocado, or uses of imitation crab meat, fried shrimp tempura, and other seafood.The name of the roll refers to the colourful pattern of raw fish and fruits across its top that resembles a rainbow.The rainbow roll is a Japanese-American creation. It originated from Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, in the late 1960s.The rainbow roll is considered as the next step of sushi introduction into the United States culinary culture after the California roll, the first roll with nori seaweed leaf hidden inside rice.While the California roll uses no raw fish at all, the rainbow roll takes it one step further by adding raw tuna, salmon, shrimp, and white fish.
